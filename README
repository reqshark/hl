hl = http-lexer 

An experimental rewrite of Node's http-parser from 2012 to not use callbacks.
Just gonna put this out there rather than let it code rot more. This is
incomplete and does not support response parsing yet. From an era before
HTTP/2.0, so some significant work needs to be done to make this thing usable
in modern web servers. But with some love I think it could be the ideal http
parser abstraction for native client/servers. 

See tests.c for example usage. Pull requests welcome.  MIT license.
